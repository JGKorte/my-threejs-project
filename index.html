			Just a weekend coding project making a browser based editor for my glb/gltf files. <br>
			Click on parts of the model to select, use the delete key on your keyboard to remove and ctrl+z to undo if you deleted something by mistake <br>
			Click and drag to orbit the camera, middle mouse to zoom and right-click to pan <br>
			On the top-right you'll find a menu to swap models and a button to export an STL file, but for some reason the exported model is tiny <br>
			so you'll need to scale it 100000% in your slicer to be the correct size. Not sure why *shrug* <br>
			I'll have that to fix on another weekend üòÖ, until then enjoy the models üòÅ <br>
      And do let me know if you found this useful! <br>
